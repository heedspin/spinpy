# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is **spinpy** - a Python project for experimenting with Python and molecular biology libraries. The repository currently contains:

- `README.md`: Basic project description "Slinging Python God Help Me"
- `.devcontainer/`: Development container configuration (untracked)

## Current State

This is a minimal Python repository that appears to be just getting started. There are no Python source files, package configuration, or development tooling set up yet.

## Data Assets

## Development Setup

Since this is a new Python project with no established tooling, you will need to:

1. Determine the appropriate Python package structure based on the intended use case
2. Set up standard Python development tools (pip, virtualenv, etc.) as needed
3. Create appropriate configuration files (setup.py, pyproject.toml, requirements.txt) based on project needs

## Architecture Notes

No established architecture exists yet - this is a greenfield Python project ready for initial development.
